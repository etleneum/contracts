There are two main functions: `makeFlip()` and `joinFlip()`. If `makeFlip()` is called, a new coinflip is registered by counting the existing number of coinflips and incrementing it by one. The person calling the contract must submit the number of players and an entry fee as well as a number of sats at least equal to the entry fee. Upon the submission of these items, the contract enters the values into the fields and adds the user who submitted the coinflip to the Players array as player 0.

A user who executes `joinFlip()` becomes another player in an existing coinflip. `JoinFlip()` first asks the user for the id number of the coinflip he or she wants to enter. For whatever coinflip id he or she submits, the script first checks if that coinflip has fewer actual players than the number of needed players as specified by the coinflip creator when registering the contract. If it does, and if, when executing the function, the user submitted as many sats as the entry fee, it registers the user as another player by adding to the json in Players. Then it executes the function `checkPlayers()`. `CheckPlayers()` checks if the number of actual players matches the number of needed players. If it does, it executes `runFlip()`. `RunFlip()` picks a random number between 1 and the number of actual players. Whatever number it picks, that is the number of the user who gets the pot in order of registration. The pot is equal to the total number of sats submitted to the contract.
